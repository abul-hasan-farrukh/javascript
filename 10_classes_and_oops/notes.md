# JavaScript and Classes

# JS has classes but this feature was introduced in ES6. One important thing to note is JS is primarily a prototype-based language. It is neither object oriented nor functional based. Everything works on PROTOTYPE, other things are just syntactic sugar.

## OOPs

# It is a way of writing code in the form of classes and objects.

## What are Objects
# - collection of properties(variables and constants) and methods(functions).
# - toLowerCase, toUpperCase

## Why use OOPs
# It allows developers to avoid spaghetti code and write a clean code.

## Parts of OOPs.
# Object Literal {} - Collection of key value pairs, properties and methods is called an object literal.

# - Constructor Fuctions - It always gives you a new copy, so you can play with it anyway you want. 
# - Prototypes
# - Classes
# - Instances (new, this) - this keyword is used to refer to the current context. Mostly used in Prototype.

## 4 Pillars of OOPs

# - Abstraction - fetch function is a good example of abstraction in JS because it hides all the details from us about the network calls. 
# - Encapsulation - It wraps the variable and methods in a single unit. 
# - Inheritance - It is used to access the methods of parent class from child class.
# - Polymorphism - If one method like console log can perform many functions then it is called polymorphism.
